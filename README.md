# ALPACA 2.0
Update for the graphical user interface (GUI) for ALPACA, a multi-channel flow-through fluorimeter for chemotaxonomic identification and classification of potential toxin production algae groups.
The software algorithm includes a supervised pattern recognition algorithm (linear discriminant analysis) and cluster algorithm (Euclidean distance) for identifying the probability of belonging. 

To access the software, you may download the python script (GUI_wizard.py and GUI_LDA_functions.py) as well as the accompaying folders (logo, measurement, and supplementary). Please save everything in one directory and keep the structure. The main script is GUI_wizard.py and can be executed with your terminal (command line front-end). If you encounter any issues, please reach out via mail at info@envipatable.com
